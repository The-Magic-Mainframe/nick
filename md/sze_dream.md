I had a nightmare last night about the System Z Enthusiasts (SZE)
Discord server. It's further evidence that SZE and members of the 
System Z community live rent-free in my head.

In the dream, I relived the moment that I realized that I had been
permanently banned from the community. The dream began with a full
screen computer display where I fired up the Discord application. The
problem was, the familiar SZE community icon that I had grown
accustomed to seeing in my server list was missing.

I had recollections of receiving a 7-day (144 hour) timeout for some
questionable posts and private messages that I had sent to the server's
moderators. I had accepted my punishment and thought that I deserved
it. It was a fair punishment, and a corrective one. I was looking
forward to the end of those 7 days when I could try to make amends for
some of my mistakes. But to my horror, my 7 day time-out had been
escalated to a permanent, lifetime ban without explanation.

The setting of my dream shifted to me standing before a receptionist's
desk where one of the community's moderators worked silently at the
keyboard. Digital badges, certificates, and accolades decorated the
wall behind him. I remember walking up to him and asking him what was
going on. His response? Silence. Some pecking away at the keyboard. And
some more silence.

But the nightmare hadn't ended. Another member of the community, who I
highly respected and looked up to as a rising star in the mainframe
community, walked into the room. She took one look at me, turned 360
degrees, and walked out a side door. Not a word, not a thought to spare
someone who was hurt, confused, and looking for answers in all the
wrong places.

I woke up from the nightmare around this point and couldn't get back to sleep for an hour. My heart was racing and the sheets were drenched. I couldn't stop thinking about the series of events that led to my permanent ban and ex-communication from a community that I loved.

Some of the emotions I felt during this hour were regret, shame,
sadness, and surprisingly, anger. Who was the anger directed at?

Mostly, myself. But also toward my colleagues, my casual acquaintances,
and my friends.

I guess it's what I deserve for being an unprofessional nuisance in a
community that values mainframes as an occupational necessity rather
than a recreational pastime.

"Diversity of thought," my ass. Cancel culture for the win.

Join the SZE community today. You'll never, ever, regret it.
