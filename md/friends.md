# friends
Remember when people used to maintain top 10 friends lists on tools
like MySpace and MyYearbook.com? Those were the days!

Linkedin is Facebook 2.

## Top 12
This list is in no particular order. That's why I used an ordered
list instead of an unordered list.

1. Tim Humphreys (Trident Services, Inc.)
2. Lionel Dyck (retired)
3. Ray Mullins (21CS)
4. PJ Catalano (IBM)
5. Emma Skovgard (some company in Europe)
