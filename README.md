Hi. My name is Nick Becker. I'm a former software engineer hailing from a small town in northwest Iowa, a state in the central United States.

I got into programming during grade school when I learned how to program my TI-84 graphing calculator. My first programming language was TI-BASIC, and I would write small little programs to help automate my math assignments. My teacher, Mr. Wingert, was supportive of my interest in programming. I consider him to be one of my earliest mentors in the world of computer science.

While my friends were organizing their top ten friend lists on MySpace and tending to each other's Farmsville farms on Facebook, I was spending most of my free time contributing to the English Wikipedia, a corpus of human knowledge. Here, I honed my skills in programming by creating my first IRC chatbot that interfaced with various MediaWiki API's.

After graduating from high school, I decided to go to college to study actuarial science. I decided to switch majors after I skipped my microeconomics exam, which was a required course in the actuarial science program. I decided to major in pure mathematics and computer science instead because I wanted to coast through the rest of my college experience instead of putting the effort in to learn something brand new.

I participated in IBM's Master the Mainframe contest for the first time in 2012. I was a part 1 and part 2 prize winner. I thought the mainframe was cool as shit. The green screen was a blast from the past. I participated in this contest two more times before I graduated from college in 2015 with my bachelor of science degree in Math and CS.

A few months before graduation, I started to freak out because I really didn't have any professional experience programming. I didn't seek out any internships while in college and the clock was ticking fast. I decided to send my resume to IBM on a whim, and I ended up securing a couple interviews with a manager in the Rochester, Minnesota area. He was looking for a fresh college graduate in the Midwest to join the JES2 development team. I took the job because I was desperate and because I didn't want to move far from my home state.

In summary, I ended up in the mainframe space and a permanent captive in the Big Blue Zoo because I was lazy and desperate. I wanted to share a cool screenshot of one of the programming challenges I did during the Master the Mainframe challenge where I learned how to use ISPF, but I can't find the PNG. Oops!

Anyway, that's my backstory. Long live the mainframe.
